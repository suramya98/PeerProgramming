# Abstract

Time is a valuable resource for students, lab demonstrators, and lecturers, particularly when it comes to providing coding assistance. The traditional method of physically addressing each student's coding issues can be cumbersome and inefficient. To overcome this challenge, peer programming has emerged as an effective solution. Real-time peer programming is a collaborative approach that allows two or more programmers to work together on the same code simultaneously. It involves sharing ideas, discussing potential solutions, and resolving coding issues in real-time. This approach fosters an environment of active engagement, knowledge sharing, and efficient problem-solving. By utilizing collaborative real-time editors, students can easily share a link with their peers, lab demonstrators, or lecturers, enabling simultaneous viewing and editing of code. Integrating this feature into existing platforms like MULE (Maynooth University Learning Environment), used at Maynooth University for programming education, proves highly beneficial. MULE offers a browser-based desktop environment that eliminates installation barriers, granting students access to programming resources from anywhere. The implementation of Firepad, a collaborative editor powered by Firebase's real-time database, allows for seamless integration of this functionality. By incorporating peer programming into MULE, the platform enhances the coding experience, fosters efficient problem-solving, and promotes collaborative efforts. This dissertation aims to explore the incorporation of peer programming in MULE and analyse the latency experienced by users collaborating on the same document within the editor.

Technologies used: Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Firepad, Docker, IDE used: Visual Studio Code.
